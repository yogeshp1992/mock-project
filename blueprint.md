### blueprints

- We use blueprints so we can register multiple sub-applications to the main application
- Blueprint is an object which is similar to Flask class object. It has same set set of attributes.
- But we only use blueprints only when we want to create sub-applications
- By using blueprint we can do "seperation of concerns"
- We can logically separate each sub-application from each other
- Every sub-application can have its own static files, template folder and view files


```python
from flask import Blueprint

blueprint_app = Blueprint("name_of_blueprint", __name__, url_prefix="/mysubapp")
```


Let's assume you've a project structure like this - 

```
project_dir   (project-root)
    - IDAM (sub-application1)
        - __init__.py
        - auth.py
    - saving_account (sub-application2)
        - __init__.py
        - saving.py 
        
    - requirements.txt
    - venv
    - main.py (entrypoint of main application)

```
